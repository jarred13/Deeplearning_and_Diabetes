# Deeplearning_and_Diabetes

This is a jupiter notebook that was published on Kaggle.

The purpose of this notebook was to see if deep learning could accuratly predict if someone has diabetes or not based on medical features.

The data set that was used is the PIMA Indian Diabetes data set. The PIMA Indians are a tribe in Arizona and more about their history can be found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pima_people

The data set consist of females over the age of 21. There are a total of 9 features including outcome, which is what the model trys to predict.

This is a binary classification problem. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors, Deep Neural Network were the models used. 

Models were evaluated with F1 score, ROC AUC, and accuracy.
